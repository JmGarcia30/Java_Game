Main Game Class (tekken_game_type)
===================================

public static void main(String[] args)
Entry point of the program
Creates Scanner object for user input

  3. Shows current player's stats and opponent summary
  4. NEW! Dynamic action menu (hides options 6 and 7 if bandage/potion already used)
  5. NEW! Input validation loop - prevents wasted turns on invalid choices
     - If bandage already used and player chooses 6, asks to choose again

4. NEW! Dynamic Menu: Shows only available actions based on item usage
5. NEW! Input Validation: Prevents wasted turns with invalid choices
6. Action Processing: Each action is executed with appropriate animations/messages
7. Turn Delay: 2-second pause between turns for readability
8. Victory Check: After each action, checks if opponent health reached 0
9. Game End: Announces winner and closes program


NEW! Status Effect System Detailed Explanation
===============================================

STUN (isStunned)
- Effect: Fighter completely skips their turn
- Applied by: Naruto's Rasengan (50% chance), Saitama's Consecutive Normal Punches (70% chance), Gojo's Cursed Technique Lapse Blue (100% chance)
- Duration: 1 turn (automatically removed after turn is skipped)
- Strategy: High-risk high-reward, can give you a free turn to set up combos

BURN (burnDamage counter)
- Effect: Deals 5 damage at the start of the affected fighter's turn
- Applied by: Asta's Black Slash
- Duration: 2 turns (counter decrements each turn)
- Strategy: Chip damage that adds up over time, good for finishing weakened opponents

SHIELD (hasShield)
- Effect: Reduces incoming damage by 50% on next attack received
- Applied by: Luffy's Gum-Gum Pistol (self-buff)
- Duration: Until next hit (consumed after absorbing one attack)
- Strategy: Defensive option that allows aggressive play with less risk

SLOW (isSlowed)
- Effect: Reduces stamina gain from basic attacks (20 → 10)
- Applied by: Goku's Kamehameha
- Duration: 1 basic attack (removed after effect triggers)
- Strategy: Slows opponent's resource generation, limiting their skill usage

FREEZE (same as Stun but thematic)
- Effect: Identical to Stun mechanically
- Applied by: Gojo's Cursed Technique Lapse Blue (guaranteed)
- Duration: 1 turn
- Strategy: Guaranteed crowd control, most reliable disable in the game


NEW! Turn Validation System
============================
Problem Solved: Previously, if a player selected an already-used item, their entire turn would be wasted
Solution: validActionChosen boolean flag with while loop

How it works:
1. At start of turn, validActionChosen is set to false
2. Loop continues until validActionChosen becomes true
3. Player makes a choice
4. System checks if choice is valid:
   - If choosing bandage (6) but bandageUsed == true: Print error, loop continues
   - If choosing potion (7) but potionUsed == true: Print error, loop continues
   - If choosing basic attack or any skill: Always valid, set validActionChosen = true
5. Try-catch block handles invalid input types (if player types letters instead of numbers)
6. Only when validActionChosen is true does the loop exit and turn ends

Result: No more wasted turns! Players can always take a meaningful action.


Key Programming Concepts Used
==============================
Object-Oriented Programming: Class with properties, constructor, and methods
Conditional Logic: if-else statements for character-specific skills and menu choices
Loops: while loop for battle continuation, NEW! while loop for input validation
User Input: Scanner class for player choices
Thread Management: Thread.sleep() for turn delays
Boolean Flags: Item usage tracking per round, NEW! status effect tracking
Exception Handling: Try-catch blocks for thread interruptions, NEW! try-catch for input validation
NEW! Random Number Generation: Math.random() for percentage-based status effect chances
NEW! Counter System: burnDamage integer counter for multi-turn effects
NEW! State Machine Logic: Status effect flags that modify behavior across multiple turns


Implementation Notes for Presentation
======================================
1. Status effects add strategic depth without overwhelming complexity
2. Each character has unique mechanics (stun chances, self-buffs, DoT effects)
3. Dynamic menu improves user experience by hiding unavailable options
4. Input validation prevents frustrating wasted turns
5. All status effects have clear visual feedback in showStats()
6. System is expandable - easy to add more status effects following same pattern
7. Balance considerations: Skill 1 has effects but lower damage, higher skills trade utility for raw power


Character Tier List (Based on Skill 1 Effects)
===============================================
S-Tier: Gojo (guaranteed freeze/stun)
A-Tier: Saitama (70% stun + high damage), Asta (burn DoT)
B-Tier: Naruto (50% stun), Goku (slow effect)
C-Tier: Luffy (shield is defensive, less impactful)

Note: This is just Skill 1 analysis - overall character balance includes all skills and base stats!
